  "instructions": [
    "Place potatoes in a large pot of cold, salted water. Bring to a boil, then simmer until fork tender (25-30 minutes).",
    "Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).",
    "While potatoes cook, make the dressing: combine mayo, yogurt, tahini, chili crisp, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, lime zest and juice in a bowl. Mix well, loosen with a splash of water if needed. Set aside in the fridge.",
    "Once potatoes are fork tender, drain and let them steam dry completely (this is important!).",
    "Place potatoes on a lined baking tray, leaving space between them. Using the bottom of a glass, firmly smash each potato flat in one motion.",
    "Season with salt and pepper, drizzle generously with olive oil.",
    "Roast for 30-45 minutes, flipping halfway, until completely crisp and golden. Add more oil if needed.",
    "Let potatoes cool slightly. Add spring onion, coriander, and sesame seeds to the dressing.",
    "In a large bowl, add half the dressing. Add the crispy potatoes and gently mix to coat. Add more dressing as needed.",
    "Serve topped with extra spring onions, sesame seeds, and a drizzle of chili crisp."
  ],
  "notes": "Jersey Royals are in season April-July and have an incredible nutty, buttery flavor. The key to crispy potatoes is letting them steam dry completely before smashing and roasting.",
